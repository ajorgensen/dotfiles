NAME
       conky  - A system monitor for X originally based on the torsmo code, but more kickass.
       It just keeps on given'er. Yeah.

SYNOPSIS
       conky [ options ]

DESCRIPTION
       Conky is a system monitor for X originally based on torsmo. Since its inception, Conky
       has  changed significantly from its predecessor, while maintaining simplicity and con-
       figurability. Conky can display just about anything, either on your root desktop or in
       its  own  window.  Not only does Conky have many built-in objects, it can also display
       just about any piece of information by using scripts and other external programs.

       Conky has more than 250 built in objects, including support for a plethora of OS stats
       (uname,  uptime,  CPU usage, mem usage, disk usage, "top" like process stats, and net-
       work monitoring, just to name a few), built in IMAP and POP3 support, built in support
       for  many  popular  music  players  (MPD, XMMS2, BMPx, Audacious), and much much more.
       Conky can display this info either as text, or using simple progress  bars  and  graph
       widgets, with different fonts and colours.

       We  are always looking for help, whether its reporting bugs, writing patches, or writ-
       ing docs. Please use the facilities at SourceForge to make bug  reports,  feature  re-
       quests,  and  submit  patches, or stop by #conky on irc.freenode.net if you have ques-
       tions or want to contribute.

       Thanks for your interest in Conky.

COMPILING
       For users compiling from source on a binary distro, make sure you have the X  develop-
       ment  libraries  installed  (Unless  you provide configure with "--disable-x11"). This
       should be a package along the lines of "libx11-dev" or "xorg-x11-dev"  for  X11  libs,
       and similar "-dev" format for the other libs required (depending on your configure op-
       tions). You should be able to see which extra packages you need to install by  reading
       errors that you get from './configure'. You can enable/disable stuff by giving options
       to configure, but be careful with disabling.  For  example:  with  --disable-math  you
       won't  get  errors  but  logarithmic graphs will be normal graphs and gauges will miss
       their line.

       Conky has (for some time) been available in the repositories of most popular distribu-
       tions. Here are some installation instructions for a few:

       Gentoo  users  -- Conky is in Gentoo's Portage...  simply use "emerge app-admin/conky"
       for installation.

       Debian, etc. users -- Conky should be in your repositories, and can  be  installed  by
       doing "aptitude install conky".

       Example  to compile and run Conky with all optional components (note that some config-
       ure options may differ for your system):

       sh autogen.sh # Only required if building from the git repo

       ./configure    --prefix=/usr     --mandir=/usr/share/man     --infodir=/usr/share/info
       --datadir=/usr/share  --sysconfdir=/etc  --localstatedir=/var/lib --disable-own-window
       --enable-audacious[=yes|no|legacy] --enable-bmpx --disable-hddtemp --disable-mpd --en-
       able-xmms2  --disable-portmon  --disable-network  --enable-debug  --disable-x11 --dis-
       able-double-buffer --disable-xdamage --disable-xft

       make

       make install # Optional

       src/conky

       Conky has been tested to be compatible with C99 C, however it has not been tested with
       anything other than gcc, and is not guaranteed to work with other compilers.

YOU SHOULD KNOW
       Conky  is  generally very good on resources. That said, the more you try to make Conky
       do, the more resources it is going to consume.

       An easy way to force Conky to reload your ~/.conkyrc: "killall -SIGUSR1 conky".  Saves
       you  the trouble of having to kill and then restart. You can now also do the same with
       SIGHUP.

              Number of times to update Conky (and quit)


CONFIGURATION SETTINGS
       Default      configuration      file      location      is      $HOME/.conkyrc      or
       ${sysconfdir}/conky/conky.conf.  On most systems, sysconfdir is /etc, and you can find
       the sample config file there (/etc/conky/conky.conf).

       You might want to copy it to $HOME/.conkyrc and then start modifying it. Other configs
       can be found at http://conky.sf.net/

       TEXT   After  this  begins text to be formatted on screen.  Backslash (\) escapes new-
              lines in the text section. This can be useful  for  cleaning  up  config  files
              where conky is used to pipe input to dzen2.


       alignment
              Aligned  position  on  screen,  may  be  top_left,  top_right, top_middle, bot-
              tom_left,  bottom_right,  bottom_middle,   middle_left,   middle_middle,   mid-
              dle_right,  or  none (also can be abreviated as tl, tr, tm, bl, br, bm, ml, mm,
              mr). See also gap_x and gap_y.


       append_file
              Append the file given as argument.


       background
              Boolean value, if true, Conky will be forked to background when started.


       border_inner_margin
              Inner border margin in pixels (the margin between the border and text).


       border_outer_margin
              Outer border margin in pixels (the margin between the border and  the  edge  of
              the window).


       border_width
              Border width in pixels.


       colorN Predefine  a  color  for use inside TEXT segments.  Substitute N by a digit be-
              tween 0 and 9, inclusively. When specifying the color value in  hex,  omit  the
              leading hash (#).


       cpu_avg_samples
              The number of samples to average for CPU monitoring.


       default_bar_size
              Specify  a default width and height for bars.  Example: 'default_bar_size 0 6'.
              This is particularly useful for execbar and execibar as they do not  take  size
              arguments.


       default_color
              Default color and border color


       default_gauge_size
              Specify a default width and height for gauges.  Example: 'default_gauge_size 25
              25'. This is particularly useful for execgauge and execigauge as  they  do  not
              take size arguments


       default_graph_size
              Specify  a default width and height for graphs.  Example: 'default_graph_size 0
              25'. This is particularly useful for execgraph and execigraph as  they  do  not
              take size arguments


       default_outline_color
              Default outline color


       default_shade_color
              Default shading color and border's shading color

              Specify an X display to connect to.


       double_buffer
              Use  the  Xdbe  extension? (eliminates flicker) It is highly recommended to use
              own window with this one so double buffer won't be so big.


       draw_borders
              Draw borders around text?


       draw_graph_borders
              Draw borders around graphs?

              Draw shades?


       extra_newline
              Put an extra newline at the end when writing to stdout, useful for  writing  to
              awesome's wiboxes.


       font   Font name in X, xfontsel can be used to get a nice font


       format_human_readable
              If  enabled, values which are in bytes will be printed in human readable format
              (i.e., KiB, MiB, etc). If disabled, the number of bytes is printed instead.


       gap_x  Gap, in pixels, between right or left border of screen, same as passing  -x  at
              command  line,  e.g.  gap_x  10.  For other position related stuff, see 'align-
              ment'.


       gap_y  Gap, in pixels, between top or bottom border of screen, same as passing  -y  at
              command  line,  e.g.  gap_y  10.  For other position related stuff, see 'align-
              ment'.


       hddtemp_host
              Hostname to connect to for hddtemp objects. Defaults to "127.0.0.1".


       hddtemp_port
              Port to use for hddtemp connections. Defaults to 7634.


       if_up_strictness
              How strict should if_up be when testing an interface for being up? The value is
              one  of  up, link or address, to check for the interface being solely up, being
              up and having link or being up, having link and an assigned IP address.


       imap   Default global IMAP server. Arguments are: "host user  pass  [-i  interval  (in
              seconds)] [-f 'folder'] [-p port] [-e 'command'] [-r retries]". Default port is
              143, default folder is 'INBOX', default interval is 5 minutes, and default num-
              ber  of  retries before giving up is 5. If the password is supplied as '*', you
              will be prompted to enter the password when Conky starts.


       imlib_cache_flush_interval
              Interval (in seconds) to flush Imlib2 cache.


       imlib_cache_size
              Imlib2 image cache size, in bytes. Defaults to 4MiB. Increase this value if you
              use $image lots. Set to 0 to disable the image cache.


       lua_draw_hook_post function_name [function arguments]
              This function, if defined, will be called by Conky through each iteration after
              drawing to the window. Requires X support. Takes any number of  optional  argu-
              ments.  Use this hook for drawing things on top of what Conky draws. Conky puts
              'conky_' in front of function_name to prevent accidental  calls  to  the  wrong
              function unless you place 'conky_' in front of it yourself.


       lua_draw_hook_pre function_name [function arguments]
              This  function,  if defined, will be called by Conky through each iteration be-
              fore drawing to the window. Requires X support. Takes any  number  of  optional
              arguments.  Use  this hook for drawing things on top of what Conky draws. Conky
              puts 'conky_' in front of function_name to  prevent  accidental  calls  to  the
              wrong function unless you place 'conky_' in front of it yourself.


       lua_load
              Loads the Lua scripts separated by spaces.


       lua_shutdown_hook function_name [function arguments]
              This function, if defined, will be called by Conky at shutdown or when the con-
              figuration is reloaded. Use this hook to clean up after yourself, such as free-
              ing  memory  which has been allocated by external libraries via Lua. Conky puts
              'conky_' in front of function_name to prevent accidental  calls  to  the  wrong
              function unless you place 'conky_' in front of it yourself.


       lua_startup_hook function_name [function arguments]
              This  function, if defined, will be called by Conky at startup or when the con-
              figuration is reloaded.  Use this hook to initialize values, or  for  any  run-
              once applications. Conky puts 'conky_' in front of function_name to prevent ac-
              cidental calls to the wrong function unless you place 'conky_' in front  of  it
              yourself.


       mail_spool
              Mail spool for mail checking


       max_port_monitor_connections
              Allow  each  port  monitor  to track at most this many connections (if 0 or not
              set, default is 256)


       max_specials
              Maximum number of special things, e.g. fonts, offsets, aligns, etc. (default is
              512)


       max_text_width width
              When a line in the output contains 'width' chars and the end isn't reached, the
              next char will start on a new line. If you want to make sure that  lines  don't
              get broken, set 'width' to 0


       max_user_text bytes
              Maximum  size  of  user text buffer, i.e. layout below TEXT line in config file
              (default is 16384 bytes)


       maximum_width pixels
              Maximum width of window


       minimum_size width (height)
              Minimum size of window

       net_avg_samples
              The number of samples to average for net data


       no_buffers
              Subtract (file system) buffers from used memory?


       nvidia_display
              The display that the nvidia variable will use (defaults to  the  value  of  the
              display variable)


       out_to_console
              Print text to stdout.


       out_to_ncurses
              Print  text in the console, but use ncurses so that conky can print the text of
              a new update over the old text. (In the future this will  provide  more  useful
              things)


       out_to_stderr
              Print text to stderr.


       out_to_x
              When  set  to no, there will be no output in X (useful when you also use things
              like out_to_console). If you set it to no, make sure that  it's  placed  before
              all  other  X-related  setting  (take  the  first line of your configfile to be
              sure). Default value is yes


       override_utf8_locale
              Force UTF8? requires XFT


       overwrite_file
              Overwrite the file given as argument.


       own_window
              Boolean, create own window to draw?


       own_window_class
              Manually set the WM_CLASS name. Defaults to "Conky".


       own_window_colour colour
              If own_window_transparent no, set a specified background  colour  (defaults  to
              black). Takes either a hex value (e.g. ffffff, note the lack of '#') or a valid
              RGB name (see /usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt)


       own_window_hints undecorated,below,above,sticky,skip_taskbar,skip_pager
              If own_window is yes, you may use these window manager hints to affect the  way
              Conky  displays. Notes: Use own_window_type desktop as another way to implement
              many of these hints implicitly. If you  use  own_window_type  override,  window
              manager hints have no meaning and are ignored.


       own_window_title
              Manually set the window name. Defaults to "<hostname> - conky".


       own_window_argb_visual
              Boolean,  use  ARGB visual? ARGB can be used for real transparency, note that a
              composite manager is required for real transparency. This option will not  work
              as desired (in most cases) in conjunction with 'own_window_type override'.


       own_window_argb_value
              When  ARGB  visuals  are enabled, this use this to modify the alpha value used.
              Valid range is 0-255, where 0 is 0% opacity, and 255 is 100% opacity.


       own_window_transparent
              Boolean, set transparency? If ARGB visual is enabled, sets  background  opacity
              to 0%.


       own_window_type
              if  own_window  is  yes,  you  may specify type normal, desktop, dock, panel or
              override (default: normal).  Desktop windows are special windows that  have  no
              window  decorations;  are always visible on your desktop; do not appear in your
              pager or taskbar; and are sticky across all workspaces. Panel  windows  reserve
              space along a desktop edge, just like panels and taskbars, preventing maximized
              windows from overlapping them. The edge is chosen based on  the  alignment  op-
              tion.  Override  windows are not under the control of the window manager. Hints
              are ignored. This type of window can be useful for certain situations.


       pad_percents
              Pad percentages to this many decimals (0 = no padding)


       pop3   Default global POP3 server. Arguments are: "host user  pass  [-i  interval  (in
              seconds)]  [-p port] [-e 'command'] [-r retries]". Default port is 110, default
              interval is 5 minutes, and default number of retries before giving up is 5.  If
              the  password  is  supplied  as '*', you will be prompted to enter the password
              when Conky starts.


       short_units
              Shortens units to a single character (kiB->k, GiB->G, etc.). Default is off.


       show_graph_range
              Shows the time range covered by a graph.


       show_graph_scale
              Shows the maximum value in scaled graphs.


       stippled_borders
              Border stippling (dashing) in pixels


       temperature_unit
              Desired output unit of all objects displaying a temperature. Parameters are ei-
              ther "fahrenheit" or "celsius". The default unit is degree Celsius.


       templateN
              Define  a  template for later use inside TEXT segments. Substitute N by a digit
              between 0 and 9, inclusively. The value of the variable is being inserted  into
              the  stuff  below TEXT at the corresponding position, but before some substitu-
              tions are applied:

              '\n' -> newline
              '\\' -> backslash
              '\ ' -> space
              '\N' -> template argument N


       text_buffer_size bytes
              Size of the standard text buffer (default is 256 bytes). This  buffer  is  used
              for  intermediary  text,  such as individual lines, output from $exec vars, and
              various other variables. Increasing the size of this buffer can drastically re-
              duce  Conky's  performance,  but will allow for more text display per variable.
              The size of this buffer cannot be smaller than the default value of 256 bytes.


       times_in_seconds
              If true, variables that output times output a number that  represents  seconds.
              This doesn't affect $time, $tztime and $utime


       top_cpu_separate

              Adds  spaces  around  certain  objects  to  stop  them from moving other things
              around. Arguments are left, right, and none (default). The old true/false  val-
              ues  are deprecated and default to right/none respectively. Note that this only
              helps if you are using a mono font, such as Bitstream Vera Sans Mono.

       xftfont
              Xft font to use.


OBJECTS/VARIABLES
       Colours  are  parsed  using  XParsecolor(),  there  might   be   a   list   of   them:
       /usr/share/X11/rgb.txt.  Colour can be also in #rrggbb format (hex).

       Some objects may create threads, and sometimes these threads will not be destroyed un-
       til Conky terminates. There is no way to destroy or clean up threads  while  Conky  is
       running. For example, if you use an MPD variable, the MPD thread will keep running un-
       til Conky dies. Some threaded objects will use one of the parameters as  a  'key',  so
       that you only have 1 relevant thread running (for example, the $curl, $rss and $weath-
       er objects launch one thread per URI).

              chars that are put  between  var1  and  var2.  For  example:  ${combine  ${head
              /proc/cpuinfo  2}  -  ${head /proc/meminfo 1}} gives as output "cpuinfo_line1 -
              meminfo_line1" on line 1 and "cpuinfo_line2 -" on line 2. $combine vars can al-
              so be nested to place more vars next to each other.

       conky_build_date
              Date Conky was built


       conky_version
              Conky version


       cpu (cpuN)
              CPU  usage  in percents. For SMP machines, the CPU number can be provided as an
              argument. ${cpu cpu0} is the total usage, and ${cpu cpuX} (X >= 1) are individ-
              ual CPUs.


       cpubar (cpuN) (height),(width)
              Bar  that  shows CPU usage, height is bar's height in pixels. See $cpu for more
              info on SMP.

       (-l)
              CPU usage graph, with optional colours in hex, minus the #. See $cpu  for  more
              info  on  SMP. Uses a logarithmic scale (to see small numbers) when you use the
              -l switch. Takes the switch '-t' to use a temperature gradient, which makes the
              gradient  values  change depending on the amplitude of a particular graph value
              (try it and see).


       curl url (interval_in_minutes)
              Download data from URI using Curl at the specified interval. The  interval  may
              be  a  floating  point  value greater than 0, otherwise defaults to 15 minutes.
              Most useful when used in conjunction with Lua and the Lua API. This  object  is
              threaded,  and  once a thread is created it can't be explicitly destroyed.  One
              thread will run for each URI specified. You can use any protocol that Curl sup-
              ports.

              "frozen" or "free " (note the padding).


       diskio (device)
              Displays current disk IO. Device is optional, and takes the  form  of  sda  for
              /dev/sda. Individual partitions are allowed.


       diskio_read (device)
              Displays current disk IO for reads. Device as in diskio.

       diskiograph  (device) (height),(width) (gradient colour 1) (gradient colour 2) (scale)
       (-t) (-l)
              Disk IO graph, colours defined in hex, minus the #. If scale  is  non-zero,  it
              becomes  the  scale  for the graph. Uses a logarithmic scale (to see small num-
              bers) when you use -l switch. Takes the switch '-t' to use a temperature gradi-
              ent,  which  makes  the  gradient values change depending on the amplitude of a
              particular graph value (try it and see).


       diskiograph_read (device) (height),(width) (gradient colour  1)  (gradient  colour  2)
       (scale) (-t) (-l)
              Disk  IO graph for reads, colours defined in hex, minus the #. If scale is non-
              zero, it becomes the scale for the graph. Device as in diskio. Uses a logarith-
              mic  scale (to see small numbers) when you use -l switch. Takes the switch '-t'
              to use a temperature gradient, which makes the gradient values change depending
              on the amplitude of a particular graph value (try it and see).


       diskiograph_write  (device)  (height),(width)  (gradient colour 1) (gradient colour 2)
       (scale) (-t) (-l)
              Disk IO graph for writes, colours defined in hex, minus the #. If scale is non-
              zero, it becomes the scale for the graph. Device as in diskio. Uses a logarith-
              mic scale (to see small numbers) when you use -l switch. Takes the switch  '-t'
              to use a temperature gradient, which makes the gradient values change depending
              on the amplitude of a particular graph value (try it and see).

       (scale) (-t) (-l)
              Download  speed graph, colours defined in hex, minus the #. If scale is non-ze-
              ro, it becomes the scale for the graph. Uses a logarithmic scale (to see  small
              numbers)  when  you  use  -l switch. Takes the switch '-t' to use a temperature
              gradient, which makes the gradient values change depending on the amplitude  of
              a particular graph value (try it and see).


       draft_mails (maildir) (interval)
              Number  of mails marked as draft in the specified mailbox or mail spool if not.

              parsing  any contained text object specifications into their output, any occur-
              ing '$$' into a single '$' and so on. The output is then being parsed again.


       eve api_userid api_key character_id
              Fetches  your  currently  training  skill  from  the  Eve  Online  API  servers
              (http://www.eve-online.com/)  and  displays  the skill along with the remaining
              training time.


       exec command
              Executes a shell command and displays the output in conky. warning: this  takes
              a  lot  more resources than other variables. I'd recommend coding wanted behav-
              iour in C and posting a patch.


       execbar command
              Same as exec, except if the first value return is a  value  between  0-100,  it
              will  use  that  number for a bar.  The size for bars can be controlled via the
              default_bar_size config setting.


       execgauge command
              Same as exec, except if the first value returned is a value between  0-100,  it
              will use that number for a gauge. The size for gauges can be controlled via the
              default_gauge_size config setting.


       execgraph (-t) (-l) command
              Same as execbar, but graphs values. Uses a logaritmic scale when the log option
              (-l  switch) is given (to see small numbers). Values still have to be between 0
              and 100. The size for graphs can be controlled via the default_graph_size  con-
              fig  setting.  Takes the switch '-t' to use a temperature gradient, which makes
              the gradient values change depending on the amplitude  of  a  particular  graph
              value  (try  it  and  see). If -t or -l is your first argument, you may need to
              preceed it by a space (' ').


       execi interval command
              Same as exec but with specific interval. Interval can't be less than update_in-
              terval in configuration. See also $texeci


       execibar interval command
              Same as execbar, except with an interval


       execigauge interval command
              Same as execgauge, but takes an interval arg and gauges values.


       execigraph interval (-t) (-l) command
              Same  as execgraph, but takes an interval arg and graphs values. If -t or -l is
              your first argument, you may need to preceed it by a space (' ').


       execp command
              Executes a shell command and displays the output in conky. warning: this  takes
              a  lot  more resources than other variables. I'd recommend coding wanted behav-
              iour in C and posting a patch. This differs from $exec in that  it  parses  the
              output of the command, so you can insert things like ${color red}hi!${color} in
              your script and have it correctly parsed by Conky. Caveats:  Conky  parses  and
              evaluates  the  output  of $execp every time Conky loops, and then destroys all
              the objects. If you try to use anything like $execi within an $execp statement,
              it  will  functionally run at the same interval that the $execp statement runs,
              as it is created and destroyed at every interval.


       execpi interval command
              Same as execp but with specific interval.  Interval  can't  be  less  than  up-
              date_interval  in  configuration. Note that the output from the $execpi command
              is still parsed and evaluated at every interval.


       flagged_mails (maildir) (interval)
              Number of mails marked as flagged in the specified mailbox  or  mail  spool  if
              not. Only maildir type mailboxes are supported, mbox type will return -1.


       font (font)
              Specify  a different font. This new font will apply to the current line and ev-
              erything following. You can use a $font with no arguments to change back to the
              default font (much like with $color)


       format_time seconds format
              Format  time  given  in  seconds. This var only works when the times_in_seconds
              configuration setting is on. Format is a string that should start and end  with
              a  "-char.  The "-chars are not part of the output, \w,\d,\h,\m,\s,\(,\) and \\
              are replaced by weeks,days,hours,minutes,seconds,(,) and \. If you leave out  a
              unit, it's value will be expressed in the highest unite lower then the one left
              out. Text between ()-chars will not be visible if a replaced unit in this  text
              is  0.  If  seconds is a decimal number then you can see the numbers behind the
              point by using \S followed by a number that specifies the amount of digits  be-
              hind  the point that you want to see (maximum 9).  You can also place a 'x' be-
              hind \S so you have all digits behind the point and no trailing  zero's.  (also

       image <path to image> (-p x,y) (-s WxH) (-n) (-f interval)
              Renders an image from the path specified using Imlib2. Takes 4  optional  argu-
              ments:  a  position,  a  size,  a  no-cache switch, and a cache flush interval.
              Changing the x,y position will move the position of the image, and changing the
              WxH will scale the image. If you specify the no-cache flag (-n), the image will
              not be cached.  Alternately, you can specify the -f int  switch  to  specify  a
              cache  flust  interval  for  a  particular  image. Example: ${image /home/bren-
              den/cheeseburger.jpg -p 20,20 -s 200x200}  will  render  'cheeseburger.jpg'  at
              (20,20) scaled to 200x200 pixels. Conky does not make any attempt to adjust the
              position (or any other formatting) of images, they are just rendered as per the
              arguments passed. The only reason $image is part of the TEXT section, is to al-
              low for runtime modifications, through $execp $lua_parse, or some other method.


       imap_messages (args)
              Displays the number of messages in your global IMAP inbox by default.  You  can

              Arguments are: "host user pass [-i interval (in  seconds)]  [-f  'folder']  [-p
              port] [-e 'command'] [-r retries]". Default port is 143, default folder is 'IN-
              BOX', default interval is 5 minutes, and default number of retries before  giv-
              ing  up is 5. If the password is supplied as '*', you will be prompted to enter
              the password when Conky starts.


       imap_unseen (args)
              Displays the number of unseen messages in your global IMAP  inbox  by  default.
              You  can define individual IMAP inboxes separately by passing arguments to this
              object. Arguments are: "host user pass [-i interval (in seconds)] [-f 'folder']
              [-p port] [-e 'command'] [-r retries]".  Default port is 143, default folder is
              'INBOX', default interval is 5 minutes, and default number  of  retries  before
              giving up is 5. If the password is supplied as '*', you will be prompted to en-
              ter the password when Conky starts.

              #.  Uses a logarithmic scale (to see small numbers) when you use the -l switch.
              Takes the switch '-t' to use a temperature gradient, which makes  the  gradient
              values  change  depending  on the amplitude of a particular graph value (try it
              and see).


       lua function_name (function parameters)
              Executes a Lua function with given parameters, then prints the returned string.
              See  also  'lua_load'  on  how to load scripts. Conky puts 'conky_' in front of
              function_name to prevent accidental calls to the wrong function unless you  put
              you place 'conky_' in front of it yourself.

              Executes  a  Lua function with given parameters and draws a bar. Expects result
              value to be an integer between 0 and 100. See also 'lua_load' on  how  to  load
              scripts.   Conky  puts 'conky_' in front of function_name to prevent accidental
              calls to the wrong function unless you put you place 'conky_' in  front  of  it
              yourself.


       lua_gauge (height, width) function_name (function parameters)
              Executes a Lua function with given parameters and draws a gauge. Expects result
              value to be an integer between 0 and 100. See also 'lua_load' on  how  to  load
              scripts.  Conky  puts  'conky_' in front of function_name to prevent accidental
              calls to the wrong function unless you put you place 'conky_' in  front  of  it
              yourself.


       lua_graph  function_name  (height),(width)  (gradient  colour  1)  (gradient colour 2)
       (scale) (-t) (-l)
              Executes a Lua function with and draws a graph.  Expects result value to be any
              number,  and  by default will scale to show the full range. See also 'lua_load'
              on how to load scripts. Takes the switch '-t' to use  a  temperature  gradient,
              which makes the gradient values change depending on the amplitude of a particu-
              lar graph value (try it and see). Conky puts 'conky_' in front of function_name
              to  prevent  accidental  calls  to  the wrong function unless you put you place
              'conky_' in front of it yourself.


       lua_parse function_name (function parameters)
              Executes a Lua function with given parameters as  per  $lua,  then  parses  and
              prints  the  result  value as per the syntax for Conky's TEXT section. See also
              'lua_load' on how to load scripts.  Conky  puts  'conky_'  in  front  of  func-
              tion_name  to prevent accidental calls to the wrong function unless you put you
              place 'conky_' in front of it yourself.

       platform (dev) type n (factor offset)
              Platform  sensor  from  sysfs  (Linux 2.6). Parameter dev may be omitted if you
              have only one platform device.  Platform type is either 'in' or  'vol'  meaning
              voltage;  'fan'  meaning fan; 'temp' meaning temperature. Parameter n is number
              of the sensor. See /sys/bus/platform/devices/ on your local computer.  The  op-
              tional  arguments  'factor' and 'offset' allow precalculation of the raw input,
              which is being modified as follows: 'input = input *  factor  +  offset'.  Note
              that they have to be given as decimal values (i.e. contain at least one decimal
              place).


       pop3_unseen (args)
              Displays the number of unseen messages in your global POP3  inbox  by  default.
              You  can define individual POP3 inboxes separately by passing arguments to this
              object. Arguments are: "host user pass [-i interval (in seconds)] [-p port] [-e
              'command']  [-r  retries]". Default port is 110, default interval is 5 minutes,
              and default number of retries before giving up is 5. If the  password  is  sup-
              plied as '*', you will be prompted to enter the password when Conky starts.


       pop3_used (args)
              Displays  the  amount of space (in MiB, 2^20) used in your global POP3 inbox by
              default. You can define individual POP3 inboxes separately by passing arguments
              to  this  object. Arguments are: "host user pass [-i interval (in seconds)] [-p
              port] [-e 'command'] [-r retries]". Default port is 110, default interval is  5
              minutes,  and  default number of retries before giving up is 5. If the password
              is supplied as '*', you will be prompted  to  enter  the  password  when  Conky
              starts.


       pre_exec shell command
              Executes  a shell command one time before conky displays anything and puts out-
              put as text.


       processes
              Total processes (sleeping and running)


       read_tcp (host) port

       replied_mails (maildir) (interval)
              Number  of  mails  marked  as replied in the specified mailbox or mail spool if
              not. Only maildir type mailboxes are supported, mbox type will return -1.


       rss uri interval_in_minutes action (num_par (spaces_in_front))
              Download and parse RSS feeds. The  interval  may  be  a  floating  point  value
              greater than 0, otherwise defaults to 15 minutes. Action may be one of the fol-
              lowing: feed_title, item_title (with num par), item_desc  (with  num  par)  and
              item_titles  (when  using this action and spaces_in_front is given conky places
              that many spaces in front of each item). This object is threaded,  and  once  a
              thread  is  created  it  can't be explicitly destroyed. One thread will run for
              each URI specified. You can use any protocol that Curl supports.

       running_processes
              Running processes (not sleeping), requires Linux 2.6


       running_threads
              Number of running (runnable) threads. Linux only.


       scroll length (step) text
              Scroll 'text' by 'step' characters showing 'length' number of characters at the
              same time. The text may also contain variables. 'step' is optional and defaults
              to 1 if not set. If a var creates output on multiple lines then the  lines  are
              placed behind each other separated with a '|'-sign. If you change the textcolor
              inside $scroll it will automatically have it's old value back  at  the  end  of
              $scroll.  The end and the start of text will be separated by 'length' number of
              spaces.


       seen_mails (maildir) (interval)
              Number of mails marked as seen in the specified mailbox or mail spool  if  not.
              Only maildir type mailboxes are supported, mbox type will return -1.


       shadecolor (color)
              Change shading color


       smapi (ARGS)
              when  using smapi, display contents of the /sys/devices/platform/smapi directo-
              ry. ARGS are either '(FILENAME)' or 'bat (INDEX)  (FILENAME)'  to  display  the
              corresponding  files' content. This is a very raw method of accessing the smapi
              values. When available, better use one of the smapi_* variables instead.


       smapi_bat_bar (INDEX),(height),(width)
              when using smapi, display the remaining capacity of the battery with index  IN-
              DEX as a bar.


       smapi_bat_perc (INDEX)
              when using smapi, display the remaining capacity in percent of the battery with
              index INDEX. This is a separate variable because it supports  the  'use_spacer'
              configuration option.


       smapi_bat_power INDEX
              when  using smapi, display the current power of the battery with index INDEX in
              watt. This is a separate variable because the original read out value is  being
              converted  from mW. The sign of the output reflects charging (positive) or dis-
              charging (negative) state.


       smapi_bat_temp INDEX
              when using smapi, display the current temperature of the battery with index IN-
              DEX  in  degree  Celsius. This is a separate variable because the original read
              out value is being converted from milli degree Celsius.


       sony_fanspeed
              Displays the Sony VAIO fanspeed information if sony-laptop  kernel  support  is
              enabled. Linux only.


       stippled_hr (space)
              Stippled (dashed) horizontal line


       swap   Amount of swap in use


       swapbar (height),(width)
              Bar that shows amount of swap in use


       swapfree
              Amount of free swap


       swapmax
              Total amount of swap


       swapperc
              Percentage of swap in use


       sysname
              System name, Linux for example


       tab (width, (start))
              Puts  a  tab  of the specified width, starting from column 'start'. The unit is
              pixels for both arguments.


       tail logfile lines (next_check)
              Displays last N lines  of  supplied  text  file.  The  file  is  checked  every
              'next_check' update. If next_check is not supplied, Conky defaults to 2. Max of
              30 lines can be displayed, or until the text buffer is filled.


       tcp_portmon port_begin port_end item (index)
              TCP port (both IPv6 and IPv4) monitor for specified local ports.  Port  numbers
              must be in the range 1 to 65535. Valid items are:

              count Total number of connections in the range
              rip Remote ip address
              rhost Remote host name
              rport Remote port number
              rservice Remote service name from /etc/services
              lip Local ip address
              lhost Local host name
              lport Local port number
              lservice Local service name from /etc/services

              The  connection  index  provides you with access to each connection in the port
              monitor. The monitor will return information for index values  from  0  to  n-1
              connections.  Values higher than n-1 are simply ignored.  For the "count" item,
              the connection index must be omitted. It is required for all other items.

              Examples:

              ${tcp_portmon 6881 6999 count} Displays the number of connections in  the  bit-
              torrent port range
              ${tcp_portmon  22  22 rip 0} Displays the remote host ip of the first sshd con-
              nection
              ${tcp_portmon 22 22 rip 9} Displays the remote host ip of the tenth  sshd  con-
              nection
              ${tcp_portmon  1  1024 rhost 0} Displays the remote host name of the first con-
              nection on a privileged port
              ${tcp_portmon 1 1024 rport 4} Displays the remote host port of the  fifth  con-
              nection on a privileged port
              ${tcp_portmon  1 65535 lservice 14} Displays the local service name of the fif-
              teenth connection in the range of all ports

              Note that port monitor variables which share the same port range actually refer
              to  the  same  monitor, so many references to a single port range for different
              items and different indexes all use  the  same  monitor  internally.  In  other
              words, the program avoids creating redundant monitors.

       templateN (arg1) (arg2) (arg3 ...)
              Evaluate the content of the templateN configuration variable (where N is a val-
              ue between 0 and 9, inclusively), applying substitutions as  described  in  the
              documentation  of the corresponding configuration variable. The number of argu-
              ments is optional, but must match the highest referred index in  the  template.
              You can use the same special sequences in each argument as the ones valid for a
              template definition, e.g. to allow an argument to contain  a  whitespace.  Also
              simple nesting of templates is possible this way.

              Here are some examples of template definitions:

              template0 $\1\2
              template1 \1: ${fs_used \2} / ${fs_size \2}
              template2 \1 \2

              The  following list shows sample usage of the templates defined above, with the
              equivalent syntax when not using any template at all:

              using template                    same without template
              ------------------------------------------------------------------
              ${template0 node name}            $nodename
              ${template1 root /}               root: ${fs_free /} /  ${fs_size
                                                /}
              ${template1  ${template2\ disk\   disk  root:  ${fs_free   /}   /
              root} /}                          ${fs_size /}

       texeci interval command
              Runs  a command at an interval inside a thread and displays the output. Same as
              $execi, except the command is run inside a thread. Use this if you have a  slow
              script  to  keep  Conky  updating. You should make the interval slightly longer
              then the time it takes your script to execute.  For  example,  if  you  have  a
              script  that take 5 seconds to execute, you should make the interval at least 6
              seconds.  See also $execi. This object will clean up the thread when it is  de-
              stroyed,  so  it can safely be used in a nested fashion, though it may not pro-
              duce the desired behaviour if used this way.


       threads
              Total threads


       time (format)
              Local time, see man strftime to get more information about format


       to_bytes size
              If 'size' is a number followed by a  size-unit  (kilobyte,mb,GiB,...)  then  it
              converts  the  size to bytes and shows it without unit, otherwise it just shows
              'size'.


       top type num
              This takes arguments in the form:top (name) (number) Basically,  processes  are
              ranked from highest to lowest in terms of cpu usage, which is what (num) repre-
              sents. The types are: "name",  "pid",  "cpu",  "mem",  "mem_res",  "mem_vsize",
              "time",  "uid", "user", "io_perc", "io_read" and "io_write". There can be a max

              Same as top, except sorted by mem usage instead of cpu


       top_time type num
              Same as top, except sorted by total CPU time instead of current CPU usage


       totaldown (net)
              Total  download,  overflows at 4 GB on Linux with 32-bit arch and there doesn't
              seem to be a way to know how many times it has already done that  before  conky
              has started.


       totalup (net)
              Total upload, this one too, may overflow


       trashed_mails (maildir) (interval)
              Number  of  mails  marked  as trashed in the specified mailbox or mail spool if
              not. Only maildir type mailboxes are supported, mbox type will return -1.


       tztime (timezone (format))
              Local time for specified timezone, see man strftime  to  get  more  information
              about format. The timezone argument is specified in similar fashion as TZ envi-
              ronment variable. For hints, look in /usr/share/zoneinfo. e.g.  US/Pacific, Eu-
              rope/Zurich, etc.

       unforwarded_mails (maildir) (interval)
              Number of mails not marked as forwarded in the specified mailbox or mail  spool
              if not. Only maildir type mailboxes are supported, mbox type will return -1.

              it becomes the scale for the graph. Uses a logarithmic scale (to see small num-
              bers) when you use the -l switch. Takes the switch '-t' to  use  a  temperature
              gradient,  which makes the gradient values change depending on the amplitude of
              a particular graph value (try it and see).

              Returns CPU #n's voltage in V. CPUs are counted from 1. If omitted, the parame-
              ter defaults to 1.


       weather URI locID data_type (interval_in_minutes)
              Download, parse and display METAR data.

              For the 'URI', there are two possibilities:

              http://weather.noaa.gov/pub/data/observations/metar/stations/
              http://xoap.weather.com/weather/local/

              The first one is free to use but the second requires you to register and obtain
              your partner ID and license key. These two must  be  written,  separated  by  a
              space,  into  a file called .xoaprc which needs to be placed into your home di-
              rectory.

              'locID' must be a valid location identifier for the required uri. For the  NOAA
              site   this   must   be   a   valid   ICAO   (see   for   instance  https://pi-
              lotweb.nas.faa.gov/qryhtml/icao/). For the weather.com  site  this  must  be  a
              valid  location ID (see for instance http://aspnetresources.com/tools/locid.as-
              px).

              'data_type' must be one of the following:

              last_update The date and time stamp of the data.  The result depends on the URI
              used.  For  the NOAA site it is date (yyyy/mm/dd) and UTC time.  For the weath-
              er.com one it is date ([m]m/[d]d/yy) and Local Time of the station.
              temperature

              Air temperature (you can use the 'temperature_unit' config  setting  to  change
              units)
              cloud_cover

              The highest cloud cover status
              pressure

              Air pressure in millibar
              wind_speed

              Wind speed in km/h
              wind_dir

              Wind direction
              wind_dir_DEG

              Compass wind direction
              humidity

              Relative humidity in %
              weather

              Any  relevant  weather  event  (rain,  snow, etc.). This is not used if you are
              querying the weather.com site since this data is aggregated into the cloud_cov-
              er one
              icon

              Weather icon (only for www.weather.com). Can be used together with the icon kit
              provided upon registering to their service.

              'delay_in_minutes' (optional, default 30) cannot be less than 30 minutes.

              This object is threaded, and once a thread is created it  can't  be  explicitly
              destroyed. One thread will run for each URI specified.

              Note that these variables are still EXPERIMENTAL and can be subject to many fu-
              ture changes.

       weather_forecast URI locID day data_type (interval_in_minutes)
              Download, parse and display weather forecast data for a given day (daytime  on-
              ly).

              For  the  'URI', for the time being only http://xoap.weather.com/weather/local/
              is supported. See 'weather' above for details of usage

              'locID', see 'weather' above.

              'day' is a number from 0 (today) to 4 (3 days after tomorrow).

              'data_type' must be one of the following:

              day Day of the week
              date Date, in the form MMM DD (ie. Jul 14)
              low Minimun temperature (you can use the 'temperature_unit' config  setting  to
              change units)
              hi  Maximum  temperature  (you can use the 'temperature_unit' config setting to
              change units)
              icon Weather icon. Can be used together with the icon kit provided upon  regis-
              tering to the weather.com service
              forecast Weather forecast (sunny, rainy, etc.)
              wind_speed Wind speed in km/h
              wind_dir Wind direction
              wind_dir_DEG Compass wind direction
              humidity Relative humidity in %
              precipitation Probability of having a precipitation (in %)

              'delay_in_minutes' (optional, default 210) cannot be lower than 210 min.

              This  object  is  threaded, and once a thread is created it can't be explicitly
              destroyed. One thread will run for each URI specified. You can use any protocol
              that Curl supports.

              Note that these variables are still EXPERIMENTAL and can be subject to many fu-
              ture changes.

LUA API
       Conky features a Lua Programming API, and also ships with Lua bindings for some useful
       libraries. Conky defines certain global functions and variables which can be  accessed
       from Lua code running in Conky.

       To  use  Lua  Conky,  you first need to make sure you have a version of Conky with Lua
       support enabled (``conky -v'' will report this). Scripts must first  be  loaded  using
       the  lua_load  configuration  option. You then call functions in Lua via Conky's $lua,
       $lua_read, and Lua hooks.

       Be careful when creating threaded objects through the Lua API. You could wind up  with
       a whole bunch of threads running if a thread is created with each iteration.

       At  this  time, the Lua API should not be considered stable and may change drastically
       from one release to another as it matures.

       NOTE: In order to accommodate certain features in the cairo library's API, Conky  will
       export  a  few  additional functions for the creation of certain structures. These are
       documented below.

       conky_parse(string) function
              This function takes a string that is evaluated as per Conky's TEXT section, and
              then returns a string with the result.

       conky_set_update_interval(number) function
              Sets Conky's update interval (in seconds) to 'number'.

       conky_window table
              This  table contains some information about Conky's window. The following table
              describes the values contained:

              drawable Window's drawable (Xlib Drawable), requires Lua extras enabled at com-
              pile time.
              visual  Window's  visual  (Xlib Visual), requires Lua extras enabled at compile
              time.
              display Window's display (Xlib Display), requires Lua extras enabled at compile
              time.
              width Window width (in pixels).
              height Window height (in pixels).
              border_inner_margin Window's inner border margin (in pixels).
              border_outer_margin Window's outer border margin (in pixels).
              border_width Window's border width (in pixels).
              text_start_x The x component of the starting coordinate of text drawing.
              text_start_y The y component of the starting coordinate of text drawing.
              text_width The width of the text drawing region.
              text_height The height of the text drawing region.

              NOTE: This table is only defined when X support is enabled.

       conky_info table
              This table contains some information about Conky's internal data. The following
              table describes the values contained:

              update_interval Conky's update interval (in seconds).
              uptime System uptime, in seconds.

       conky_build_info string
              A string containing the build info for this particular instance of  Conky,  in-
              cluding the version, build date, and architecture.

       conky_build_date string
              A string containing the build date for this particular instance of Conky.

       conky_build_arch string
              A  string  containing  the  build  architecture for this particular instance of
              Conky.

       conky_version string
              A string containing the version of the current instance of Conky.

       conky_config string
              A string containing the path of the current Conky configuration file.

       cairo_text_extents_t:create() function
              Call this function to return a new cairo_text_extents_t structure.  A  creation
              function  for  this  structure  is not provided by the cairo API. After calling
              this, you should use tolua.takeownership() on the return value to ensure owner-
              ship is passed properly.

       cairo_font_extents_t:create() function
              Call  this  function to return a new cairo_font_extents_t structure. A creation
              function for this structure is not provided by the  cairo  API.  After  calling
              this, you should use tolua.takeownership() on the return value to ensure owner-
              ship is passed properly.

       cairo_matrix_t:create() function
              Call this function to return a new cairo_matrix_t structure. A  creation  func-
              tion  for  this structure is not provided by the cairo API. After calling this,
              you should use tolua.takeownership() on the return value to ensure ownership is
              passed properly.

EXAMPLES
       conky -t '${time %D %H:%M}' -o -u 30
              Start Conky in its own window with date and clock as text and 30 sec update in-
              terval.

       conky -a top_left -x 5 -y 500 -d
              Start Conky to background at coordinates (5, 500).

       conky -C > ~/.conkyrc
              Do not start Conky, but have it output  the  builtin  default  config  file  to
              ~/.conkyrc for later customising.

FILES
       ${sysconfdir}/conky/conky.conf
              Default  system-wide configuration file.  The value of ${sysconfdir} depends on
              the compile-time options (most likely /etc).

       ~/.conkyrc
              Default personal configuration file.

BUGS
       Drawing to root or some other desktop window directly doesn't  work  with  all  window
       managers.  Especially  doesn't  work  well with Gnome and it has been reported that it
       doesn't work with KDE either. Nautilus can be disabled from drawing  to  desktop  with
       program gconf-editor. Uncheck show_desktop in /apps/nautilus/preferences/. There is -w
       switch in Conky to set some specific window id. You might find xwininfo  -tree  useful
       to find the window to draw to.  You can also use -o argument which makes Conky to cre-
       ate its own window. If you do try running Conky in its own window, be sure to read  up
       on the own_window_type settings and experiment.
